This script uses the Solidity compiler to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the smart contract, and the Solhint linter to analyze the AST and identify coding issues. The compile_contract() function compiles the contract and returns the AST as a JSON object. The lint_contract() function extracts the contract source code from the AST, saves it to a temporary file, runs the Solhint linter on the file, and prints any issues found.

To use this script, you will need to install the Solidity compiler and the Solhint linter on your machine.
